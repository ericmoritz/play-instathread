# instathread

Instathread is a service to enable quick ad-hoc "protected" discussion
threads.

# How it works

You create the thread, share the private URL with your friends, and
discuss.  The discussion is as private as the URL is so keep that in
mind.

# Why?

Sometimes you need to have a quick discussion about something without
SPAMing your email or SPAM Twitter or Facebook with a trivial
conversation.  Need to discuss lunch plans? Instathread it.

# But what if I want to archive the conversation?

I don't know, print it, do a save-as or use some other service.
